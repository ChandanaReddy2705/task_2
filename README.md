# task_2
I wrote code to check a dataset Titanic . I used pandas to load and look at the data, find basic stats, and see how numbers connect. I made charts like histograms, box plots, count plots, and a scatter plot with matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. I learned how to summarize data, show patterns, and deal with missing files by using a sample dataset.
